	<h2>Oh My God It's So Hot</h2>

	<div class="post">
	<p>Well, it&#39;s day two, and I haven&#39;t quit yet. Today&#39;s run was brutal. As it turns out, I decided to start this project right in the middle of a heat wave. According to forecast.io, it was only about 90 degrees when I was out (down from 98 earlier), but the humidity was unbelievable. My shirt was completely soaked through when I got back, but I did get back this time. I finished the full 3.1 miles, but I&#39;m going to have to recover well if I&#39;m going to make it through Sunday&#39;s 4 miler. I haven&#39;t started planning routes yet, but I think what I&#39;ll do is try to extend the 5k I just did a little bit in every direction, so that I don&#39;t feel the extra mile as much. The route that I ran today was one I found on mapmyrun.com, adapted a little bit to start and end right at my apartment. It was probably the nicest route I&#39;ve run around here: it does an excellent job avoiding long hills, and it&#39;s got lots of turns so you&#39;re never stuck in one impossibly long stretch.</p>

<p>The heat wave is supposed to break by Sunday, but I think I may have to move my runs to either pre- or post-daylight regardless.     I&#39;ve found in the past that I don&#39;t usually do well in the mornings, but I&#39;m fine heading out at 10:30 or 11 PM. On the other hand, that makes for somewhat of a late night, and it can be nice to get a run out of the way early in the day.</p>
