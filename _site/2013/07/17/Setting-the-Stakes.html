	<h2>Setting the Stakes</h2>

	<div class="post">
	<p>Today, after watching about twenty minutes of a movie about marathons, I decided I&#39;d like to run a half marathon. The Baltimore Running Festival Half Marathon. It is on October 12, 2013, which is 12.5 weeks from today, July 17, 2013. After about two solid minutes of research, I found a half marathon training plan that is exactly 12 weeks long, and starts around three miles (though I missed the first day, which was supposed to be yesterday). On the schedule for today: 2 miles. </p>

<p>So I tossed back my glass of milk (probably not the best idea pre-run), pulled on my shoes, and hit the road. I trekked my way up to Druid Hill Park: my goal was to get up to the park, run a lap around the 1.5 mile track, and walk back. I didn&#39;t make it all the way; the 95 degree heat and general Baltimore swampiness overcame my enthusiasm a little more than half way through the lap, but my total running mileage still came in at 2.17 miles, adequately fulfilling today&#39;s quota. </p>

<p>The furthest (farthest?) I&#39;ve ever run is ten kilometers, but the most recent 10k I ran was in the spring of seventh grade. I&#39;m twenty now, and I&#39;m ashamed to say that there&#39;s no way I could run 6 miles in my current state. I am 6 feet, 2 inches tall, and as of this morning I weighed 204 pounds. I&#39;m not huge,  but I&#39;m also not at a point in my life where I have any excuse to be overweight. My friends are mostly fit, my family is very healthy, I don&#39;t have any bad genes, and I&#39;m not an unmotivated person. I&#39;ve been teetering on the brink of overweight for years, but I&#39;ve always been ashamed to publicly admit that I&#39;d like to lose weight. Well fuck that. I&#39;d like to lose some weight. I&#39;ll feel better, look better, and live better if I weigh a bit less.</p>

<p>But please don&#39;t think this is a weight loss blog. I would much rather think of my goals in terms of achievements than losses. So this is a running blog, spawned from a spontaneous decision to shoot for an unlikely goal, and a brief moment of conviction that I am capitalizing on to build a 13.1 mile long open-ended box around myself where I am on the closed end and the only way to get to the open end is by running there with my feet, propelled by the forces of public failure and cheap bribery.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the stakes. As a child, my dad told me that if I stopped biting my nails for long enough to get them clipped, I would get a treat. It took three months of snapping my wrist raw with a rubber band, but one day my nails were long enough pass muster. After Dad clipped them for me, we went out to target, and I got a sweet-ass Billy Blazes <a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/img/product_shots/V0294-rescue-heroes-billy-blazes-b-1.jpg">Rescue Hero</a>. Then I waited a week for my nails to grow back a little and started biting them again, and I haven&#39;t stopped again since. But that&#39;s not the point. The point is: I&#39;m going to use this as an excuse to get some cool sports shit.</p>

<h3>Treat Number One: 5 miles</h3>

<p>If/when I run 5 miles, which would be the longest distance I have run since middle school, I will get: One (1) pair of moisture-wicking shorts and one (1) moisture-wicking shirt. Total estimated cash value: $40.00.</p>

<h3>Treat Number Two: 8 miles</h3>

<p>At 8 miles, I will officially drop the cash money to register for the Baltimore Running Festival Half Marathon.</p>

<h3>Treat Number Three: 10 miles</h3>

<p>The big one-oh! Good job, me. This distance seems incomprehensibly far to me today. If I successfully run ten miles, I will get a cool watch that tells me how far I run.</p>

<h3>Treat Number Four: 13.1 Miles</h3>

<p>I&#39;m leaving this one open for now, partly because I can&#39;t think of anything, and partly because it will probably be fun to think of things as I get closer. </p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<ol>
<li>I will run on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, following the mileage indicated on <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program">this schedule</a>, and cross-train on Saturdays.</li>
<li>I will make a short post on this blog every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday reporting my progress.</li>
<li>If I do not meet the requirements of the schedule on any day for any reason other than illness, serious injury, or extenuating circumstance, I will publicly announce my failure to do so via Twitter or Facebook.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are the parameters. I am now icing my shins; I have 3 miles to knock down tomorrow before Friday&#39;s rest day. There are a few things that I know will be essential if I am to have any chance at all of completing this project:</p>

<ol>
<li>Diet: I need to make sure that I&#39;m eating food makes me feel good, and doesn&#39;t sit heavy in my stomach.</li>
<li>Sleep: Last night I didn&#39;t sleep very well. If I&#39;m going to keep up with this schedule I need to make sure that I am in bed at a reasonable hour, and that the quality of my sleep is high.</li>
<li>Routine: Not an issue yet, but when/if I start running 8+ miles, it&#39;s going to take up a decent amount of time. I need to plan for the time that running will take up.</li>
<li>Interest: I have to keep myself excited about running. Last semester I read Haruki Murakami&#39;s <em>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</em>, and that was tremendously helpful in getting me out running for a while. It will be important that I devote time to maintaining my interest in what I&#39;m doing.</li>
</ol>
