	<h2>First Test</h2>

	<div class="post">
	<p>Currently drying off after my first &quot;long run&quot; of the program. In case you don&#39;t know, training programs for long distance runs like marathons, half-marathons, &amp;c are generally structured to include three or so normal length runs throughout the week to maintain fitness, and one long run on the weekend to push endurance to the next level. Over the course of the program, all of the distances get longer, but the mileage ratio between long and maintenance runs stays about the same. </p>

<p>Today&#39;s run was 4 miles; I planned a course that was about 4.1 miles of running and has a built in .75 mile cool down walk from the end of the course back to my house. I started at home, ran down Mt. Royal, then took Charles down to the Inner Harbor, ran along the harbor to the Science Center, then took St. Paul back to Mt. Royal. It went better than I could have hoped, considering how beat I was after Thursday&#39;s 5k. I finished in 44 minutes, which is a 10:45 pace. Slow, but I didn&#39;t want to push too hard and run out of steam, especially since the second half of the course is pretty much steadily uphill. I&#39;m trying to decide if I prefer courses that have more turns or if I prefer long, straight routes. Having a lot of turns means that you don&#39;t feel the distance as much, but it&#39;s also more difficult to pace yourself since there are fewer points of reference. When the course is basically just an out-and-back sort of thing you always know how far you are from the finish, which is great towards the end, but not-so-great in the beginning. </p>

<p>I also decided to try a morning run today. When I left the house at 8:10 it was about 80 degrees out, and it felt wonderful. I&#39;d like to continue running in the morning, but it will mean shifting my sleep schedule so that I can get up early enough to run before work. It usually takes me a long time to cool off after a run, and if I try to walk the three-quarters of a mile to my job too soon after a run I&#39;ll be dripping by the time I get there.</p>

<p>At any rate, I&#39;m feeling pretty good after my first long run (which was probably longer than any distance I&#39;ve run since starting school in Baltimore), and I&#39;m excited to see how I feel next weekend at the same distance.</p>
