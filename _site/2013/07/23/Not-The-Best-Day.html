	<h3>Day 4</h3>
	<h2>Not The Best Day</h2>

	<p>That was definitely rough. I decided to try waking up early to get in my run before work today, and it was painful. I woke up around 5:45 and the first thing I noticed was that my stomach felt a little bit off. I had pizza last night, and I think it may have still been settling. I dragged myself out of bed at six, forced down a Clif bar and a glass of water, and used the bathroom. I waited until 6:30 to let the food start to digest, and I headed out. It was cool outside, with gray skies and a little drizzle that seemed to be the aftermath of a serious rainstorm. The brick sidewalk was slippery. Very quickly I started feeling pain in my shins and ankles, which is normal, but today it was more persistent than usual. I managed to run through it, but I could definitely feel my form suffer as I struggled to find a comfortable pace and stride. I hoped that being out by 6:30 would mean avoiding traffic, but it seems I was wrong. It felt like I was stuck at almost every light waiting for cars to pass. Buses stopped and started next to me, spewing stinky black smoke. At one point I held my breath for half a block because there was a garbage truck and the smell was so terrible. </p>

<p>In the end I made it back without walking. My pace was quite slow, but I&#39;m proud that I pushed through the leg pain. It was definitely an arduous run, but I still finished it.</p>
