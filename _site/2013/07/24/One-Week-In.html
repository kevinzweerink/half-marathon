	<h3>Day 5</h3>
	<h2>One Week In</h2>
	<p class="date">24 Jul 2013 &mdash; 2.1 miles</p>

	<div class="post">
	<p>I woke up before my alarm today, at 5:55. I felt good, much better than I did yesterday morning. I got up easily, ate a banana, drank some water, and waited for 6:30 to head out. This morning was very nice: the sun was rising, there were very few clouds, and the temperature was cool. Today&#39;s run on the schedule was only 2 miles, and I was glad because my shins started bothering me early in my run this morning. After I got back home I did some research and found a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5902699/banish-shin-splints-forever-with-one-magical-exercise">Gizmodo article</a> that claims to have a great exercise to alleviate shin splints. I tried it out and I could definitely feel the muscles that the moves work on, so I&#39;m going to give it a shot for the next week or so and see if anything changes.</p>

<p>All things considered, one week in, I&#39;m feeling pretty good. I&#39;m tired; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve fully recovered from Sunday&#39;s run yet, but I&#39;m definitely improving. Tomorrow is probably going to be painful, but I can&#39;t lose momentum.</p>
