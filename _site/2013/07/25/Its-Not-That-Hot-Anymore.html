	<h2>It's Not That Hot Anymore</h2>

	<div class="post">
	<p>I didn&#39;t think I was going to go this morning. I was up last night icing my legs and thought that maybe I would wait until the afternoon for my run today. I still set my alarm, and when it went off this I set it again for an hour later. I figured I would just wait until the afternoon. When it went off again, I remembered that today is Thursday, and on Thursdays work doesn&#39;t start until 10. So I decided I would get up, get ready, and see how I felt. Sure enough, after spending the time to get ready to go, I wanted to go out and run. My run today was a 5k more or less, and the route I planned front-loaded the hills. After mile 2, it was basically all downhill. I was definitely tired by the time I got to the point where the elevation gain switches, but I felt better at the end of the course than I had a mile earlier, so that was encouraging. Today&#39;s weather was gray, but very pleasant. It was about 62 degrees when I left the house, which felt incredible. It looks like Baltimore is in for a little bit of a cold front; temperatures won&#39;t be above 86 for at least a week.</p>
