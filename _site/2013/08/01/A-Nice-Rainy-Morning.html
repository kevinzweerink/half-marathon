	<h2>A Nice Rainy Morning</h2>

	<div class="post">
	<p>Today&#39;s run went far better than yesterday&#39;s. My route took me up again to Hopkins, this time looping through the campus and returning on Charles to end at Mount Royal for a total of three and three-quarters miles. The route I planned was actually shorter, but I took a wrong turn on the Hopkins campus and ended up adding an extra quarter mile without realizing. I felt good the whole time, there was minimal shin pain, and the light drizzle kept me cool, though unfortunately it picked up into a heavier rain that soaked me thoroughly as I walked home. I feel like recently (excepting yesterday) I&#39;ve been able to find a sort of stasis while running that was previously difficult to achieve; a combination of good pacing and mental preparation that makes it easier to remove oneself from the physical act of running.</p>

<p>I thought a lot yesterday about what could be causing my poor performance on Wednesdays, which are supposed to be the easiest day of my training schedule. A few things I&#39;ve noticed that I do most nights before a run, but have not done on Tuesday nights:</p>

<ol>
<li>Carrots with peanut butter. I think that the slow-digesting carbs and protein from the peanut butter help me out a lot in the morning.</li>
<li>Icing my shins/legs. I haven&#39;t done this on Tuesdays yet because I&#39;ve been assuming the shorter distance should be easier, and I feel strong on my Tuesday morning runs.</li>
<li>Underestimating. I assume that because the distance is short it will be easy and I don&#39;t pump myself up as well. Two miles isn&#39;t long, but my legs are probably still recovering from the long run on Sunday.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, next Tuesday I&#39;ll try to be more conscious of what I eat the night before and take care of my legs a little better. Today&#39;s run went excellently though, and I&#39;m excited for my 5 mile run on Sunday</p>
