	<h2>Running Across The Country</h2>

	<div class="post">
	<p>Across the country from where I was is what I mean. I am on the other side of the country from the side that I live on, and I&#39;ll be here for the next month. Today was my first run on this side of the country, and it went pretty well. I bike about 5 or 6 miles round trip to work here, and we leave at 6 AM, so my running time now has to shift to evening. I haven&#39;t gone running shortly after biking before, and it is definitely more of a transition than I was expecting. Starting out, my legs felt stiff and heavy, which persisted until about half way through the run, when I decided to do some high knee strides to loosen up, and that seemed to help. I had some shin pain throughout the run, but nothing excruciating.</p>

<p>I ran on a beautiful path that goes from downtown Mountain View towards the bay. It is the same path that we ride to work every day, and I basically followed it half way to work and then turned around. There are some beautiful views of the coastal mountains, and it passes by the NASA Ames Research Center, which  has a colossal hangar that was quite nice in the sunset. In California, it seems that the sunset lasts from about 4:30 to 8:30. I was close to skipping today&#39;s run on account of travel, adjustment, &amp;c, but I am glad that I did not. Afterwards I soaked my legs in the hotel pool while I cooled down.</p>
