	<h2>Mid-Week Drag Pays Off</h2>

	<div class="post">
	<p>I was hoping that the difficulty I had this week running at night after bicycling 6 miles round trip to and from work every day would put me in a better position for my weekend long runs, and it seems I was right. Today&#39;s run took me from the hotel I am staying at out to the edge of the San Francisco bay and back for a total distance of 5.37 miles. Last weekend I couldn&#39;t make it the full 5 miles I had planned without walking. This weekend I sprinted the last quarter mile. It felt great to run on legs that finally felt fresh and springy. I only began to feel fatigued at all during the last three-quarters of a mile or so. Today was definitely my best long run to date.</p>

<p>I am thinking about maybe trying to get my runs in before work, even though I leave for work at 6:00 AM most mornings. The difference between running fresh and running after a day of work and biking is huge, and may be worth getting up around 5 for. Perhaps not though, as the trail I like to run on doesn&#39;t have any lights, it will still be pitch black for most of my runs, plus my mileage bumps up to 4 miles on Tuesdays and Thursdays this week.</p>

<p>Next weekend I have a six mile run on my training schedule, which will mean tying my all-time personal distance record, set in middle school when I ran two 10k&#39;s. After this week&#39;s run, I am totally confident that I will be able to do it, though there&#39;s a good chance I will be in San Francisco for the weekend, and finding a flat-ish course around there will probably be difficult.</p>
