	<h2>A Short Long Run</h2>

	<div class="post">
	<p>Today&#39;s run was alright. Because I knew it was a much shorter distance than previous long runs, I started out too fast, and never really settled into a comfortable pace. I finished in about 30 minutes, which is pretty quick for me, but my split was definitely way positive. </p>

<p>I talked to my Mom on the phone, and she told me that she had been having knee pains, but just switched to a stability shoe and felt much better. Since today is my last real free day in California, and I don&#39;t know of any actual running stores I can get to in Baltimore, I decided to take the Caltrain up to Menlo Park to visit the running store up there and talk to someone with some expertise about the shin pain I&#39;ve been having. Personally, I thought there was a chance that it was my shoes, since I hadn&#39;t had any issues like this before I switched (I was also running significantly less). Luckily, the person I spoke with at the store disagreed.</p>

<p>I was worried that once I explained my situation to the associate at the running store, he would tell me I needed to take it slower, give my muscles a chance to heal. He wasn&#39;t a doctor, but he didn&#39;t seem to concerned. He told me that it was a really common problem (&quot;well, more of an annoyance really&quot;), and after watching my walk around for a minute he told me that I needed more arch support, and that inserts for my shoes would probably help reduce the stress on my tibialis muscles. He also recommended that I get a massage stick to roll out the muscles in that part of my leg, which will improve blood flow and aid recovery. After spending the past five minutes or so using the stick on my legs they feel greatly relaxed. Overall, I was surprised and encouraged by the associate&#39;s attitude, which seemed to be that this was an easily solvable problem that shouldn&#39;t slow me down.</p>

<p>This week is where the training program really starts to turn up. My medium runs bump up to 4.5 miles twice a week, short runs jump a mile up to 3 miles on Wednesdays (gonna suck), and my long run next Sunday is 7 miles, which will be the furthest I&#39;ve ever run. Also, long runs start increasing weekly rather than biweekly from here on out.</p>
