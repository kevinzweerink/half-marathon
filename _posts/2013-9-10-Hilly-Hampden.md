Today I decided to try a run that started out uphill instead of going down towards the harbor. I did a lot of these earlier in my training schedule, but it had been a while and I wanted to do a run that got easier rather than harder. Today's distance was 5 miles (the peak distance for mid-length runs) so I planned a 5.33 mile route that went up to Johns Hopkins, then Hampden, then came back down Falls Road and over 83 to Druid Hill Park, and from there went about halfway down the reservoir and back down Mount Royal Terrace to North Avenue. It was a hard run. All of the hills were much steeper than I realized, particularly coming back down Falls Road, which wound through a wooded area with no sidewalk and little visibility around turns. It was also quite humid today. I think I started out too fast, hoping to tackle the hills quickly and then coast back down, but by the time I got to Hampden I had slowed significantly, and the hills on the way home were sufficiently steep as not to lend themselves to coasting. And of course, my legs were still quite tired from Sunday's 8 miles. I made it back quicker than I was expecting though, door-to-door (including about half a mile of walking) in just under an hourâ€”not a fast time by any means, but not as slow as I felt.
