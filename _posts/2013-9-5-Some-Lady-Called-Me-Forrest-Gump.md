Today's run went pretty well. My legs were very tired by the end, I think because I have stopped drinking this green "superfood" drink powder that I got a while ago. I recently looked at the package and noticed that the one I got is the "energy" blend, which means that it has a bunch of caffeine in it. Also it tastes really bad. They tried to flavor it like lemon-lime or something but it just tastes terrible. I might still drink it before long runs, but I am not a fan of choking a glass of that stuff down right after I wake up at 6:00 AM.

Today's route took me down to the Inner Harbor via Charles, a little loop by the bay, returning on Cathedral. Once I got to the Harbor I discovered that they are setting up for some Ravens  celebration or something. I was able to get onto the brick boardwalk that goes next to the water, and run down it for a little while, but once I got about two-thirds of the way to the science center I noticed that there was a fence in my way. I saw a woman who I guess was working security standing by an open gate, and I figured I'd ask her if it was alright for me to continue through the fenced area. As I approached she shouted at me to turn around and go back the way I came, calling me Forrest Gump about 4 times in two sentences. I thought that was kind of rude, though I guess I was running, and I do have a beard. Also her job is probably mostly turning away runners, which is probably pretty boring. I had to do some last minute route reconfiguration, but I ended up getting in a quarter of a mile more than the required distance for today.
