I was very cold this morning. 52 isn't freezing or anything, but it's only been a week since it was like 80 when I was out running. Tomorrow I am wearing my base layer pants and maybe a long-sleeve shirt. I could definitely feel the cooler temperatures effecting on my leg muscles, particularly the thigh muscles, which felt tight and sluggish for most of my run. On the other hand, I was cold and wanted to go back inside, so I ran fairly quickly; I finished the 5 mile course in 45 minutes. I'd say this is definitely an improvement over 80 degrees and a million percent humidity, but I wish there would be more days where it's the perfect temperature for running, like it was on Sunday.
