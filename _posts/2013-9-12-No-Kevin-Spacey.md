Kevin Spacey did not respond to my twitter invitation to join me for my run this morning. That's okay, I didn't really expect that he would. I started with a little neighborhood loop, then ran up Howard and Charles to 33rd, then did a little loop from 33rd to Barclay to 32nd back to Charles, then ran back on Charles to Mt Royal. 5 miles is a pretty long way to run as soon as you wake up. Also I forgot to drink anything before I left this morning, so I was really thirsty pretty much the whole time. Looking forward to an easy 10k this weekend.
