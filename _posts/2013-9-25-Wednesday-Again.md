This Wednesday was at least better than last. I thought I was going pretty slow the whole time, but ended up finishing the 3 mile course in about 25 minutes. I accidentally planned a route that had a San Francisco-esque hill on it—from Guilford up Monument to Charles—so that was a mistake, but I made it up without dying or anything. Other than that, there's not much to report. I read the wrong day's weather so I was a little cold, but it wasn't too bad. Could have gone much worse, like last Wednesday.
