Another stupid Wednesday, running-wise. Shin pain and quadricep fatigue start-to-finish. I suppose pain is an important part of training, because running 13 miles is going to hurt the first time I do it. Building up mental resistance to physical discomfort is probably just as essential to finishing the race as building physical resistance to stress. It's also probably helpful for calibrating my own injury radar. Without the context of the past few weeks, I might more be worried that I was on a bad path, but judging by recent patterns, tomorrow my shins will feel pretty much fine, and I'll be able to finish out the week with much less pain.
