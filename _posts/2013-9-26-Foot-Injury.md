This morning I almost didn't go running. After my run yesterday I noticed a pain on the top of my right foot. I hoped it was just from having my shoes tied to tight or something like that. This morning when I woke up, it still hurt. I decided to get ready and see how it felt when it was actually time to run. By 6:30 it still hurt some, but I decided to get out and run for a little while and see if it still hurt. After about half a mile it still hurt, and I almost turned back. After a mile, it didn't hurt anymore, so I pressed onward. After 5 miles it definitely hurt again, and it still hurts now, in the evening. I have Friday and Saturday to rest it, and I will use lots of ice and whatever else I can to make it heal quickly. I don't want to be injured. While I probably shouldn't have run this morning, I am sort of proud that I did, because at the before I started training I probably would have used much less as an excuse not to run. I felt, this morning, as though I had successfully built up some internal drive.
