I ran fast today, 4.24 miles over 35 minutes. An 8:15 pace. I won't be qualifying for Boston any time soon, but that's nearly 2 minutes off my normal mile time. About halfway through the run I started to feel some burning in my calves, presumably resulting from the altitudinal anomaly of Sunday's six miles in San Francisco. I started out with minor shin pain and a little stiffness from the bike ride home, but within the first mile I found a comfortable and surprisingly fast pace. My form felt very strong; foot-strike was solidly mid-to-forefoot, and my passive stride (a word I made up for the part of running where your back foot moves from behind you back to the front of you) was well articulated. I read online a while ago that the articulation of that motion is very important, that sort of kicking your heels up, or allowing them to be kicked up and brought back around in an active and fully expressed motion—as opposed to just sort of letting your lower leg dangle from your knee while you drag everything forward—sets a much higher tension in the hamstring, which acts sort of like a taut rubber band when you push off the ground again, resulting in a stronger and more efficient stride. I've always found this difficult to do consistently at slower paces, but when running a bit faster the momentum in the legs is high enough that the heels nearly raise themselves, and the motion becomes much more natural.

Also, for the first time ever, I was pretty hungry while running. I ate less than usual today (mostly salad for lunch and dinner), so I suppose that probably had something to do with it. Running while hungry was not entirely unpleasant. I felt lighter on my feet, since my stomach was complaining about not being full of things, and a decent part of the reason I kept up such a quick pace was that I wanted to get back to the hotel and eat a snack.

Overall, another good day for training. Tomorrow will be terrible, because it is Wednesday, and Wednesday is always terrible for running, but it will be over before I know it.
