Today was (as expected) much better than yesterday. The miles went by slowly and not painlessly, but it was quite surmountable. The route I've been taking when it's too dark to take the trail leads to a road called Miramonte, from which you can mira el monte, so that's nice (I'm not sure which monte it is, but it's a good one). Anyway, not much to report. I'm excited to test myself in SF this weekend; not only does my distance bump up to six miles, but I imagine it will be difficult to find a course as flat as those here in Mountain View.
