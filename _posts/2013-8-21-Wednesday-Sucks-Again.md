As expected, today was an awful day for running. My shins hurt the whole way, and it feels stupid to be so incapacitated when yesterday I ran twice this distance and felt great pretty much the whole time. When I got back I did some more of the [shin splint exercises](http://gizmodo.com/5902699/banish-shin-splints-forever-with-one-magical-exercise) I started but never kept up with about a month ago. I did them a few times when I first gave them a try, but after Wednesday, when nothing hurt anymore, I would forget to continue. This time I'm going try to stick with them for longer, and might try to find a foam roller at the gym at work.
