title: Wednesday Didn't Suck!
day: 43

A change has occurred! Today, for the first time since I started training, Wednesday did not suck. And the distance increased by a mile! Now, there are two possible reasons why this might have happened. Possible reason number one is that the inserts for my shoes and the rolly massage stick I've been using on my legs have worked together to improve my shin pain situation. The second possible cause is that this weekend's "long run" was a much shorter distance than previous weekends (as per [training schedule](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program)), and yesterday I got a little lost and accidentally split my run in to two separate runs (though the total distance was significantly longer than the required distance). I'm hoping for the former.

Regardless, it was good to have a win. I worried all day about how today's run would pan out, given my faux-pas yesterday, and that I've been feeling more sluggish this week. Once I got out on the trail I felt strong, and though I did get pretty tired by the end, it went far better than I was hoping.
