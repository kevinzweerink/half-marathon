title: Setting the Stakes
---

Today, after watching about twenty minutes of a movie about marathons, I decided I'd like to run a half marathon. The Baltimore Running Festival Half Marathon. It is on October 12, 2013, which is 12.5 weeks from today, July 17, 2013. After about two solid minutes of research, I found a half marathon training plan that is exactly 12 weeks long, and starts around three miles (though I missed the first day, which was supposed to be yesterday). On the schedule for today: 2 miles. 

So I tossed back my glass of milk (probably not the best idea pre-run), pulled on my shoes, and hit the road. I trekked my way up to Druid Hill Park: my goal was to get up to the park, run a lap around the 1.5 mile track, and walk back. I didn't make it all the way; the 95 degree heat and general Baltimore swampiness overcame my enthusiasm a little more than half way through the lap, but my total running mileage still came in at 2.17 miles, adequately fulfilling today's quota. 

The furthest (farthest?) I've ever run is ten kilometers, but the most recent 10k I ran was in the spring of seventh grade. I'm twenty now, and I'm ashamed to say that there's no way I could run 6 miles in my current state. I am 6 feet, 2 inches tall, and as of this morning I weighed 204 pounds. I'm not huge,  but I'm also not at a point in my life where I have any excuse to be overweight. My friends are mostly fit, my family is very healthy, I don't have any bad genes, and I'm not an unmotivated person. I've been teetering on the brink of overweight for years, but I've always been ashamed to publicly admit that I'd like to lose weight. Well fuck that. I'd like to lose some weight. I'll feel better, look better, and live better if I weigh a bit less. To put a number to it: 185.

God but this isn't a weight loss blog. I would much rather think of my goals in terms of achievements than losses. So this is a running blog, spawned from a spontaneous decision to shoot for an unlikely goal, and a brief moment of conviction that I am capitalizing on to build a 13.1 mile long open-ended box around myself where I am on the closed end and the only way to get to the open end is by running there with my feet, propelled by the forces of public failure and cheap bribery.

Which brings me to the stakes. As a child, my dad told me that if I stopped biting my nails for long enough to get them clipped, I would get a treat. It took three months of snapping my wrist raw with a rubber band, but one day my nails were long enough pass muster. After Dad clipped them for me, we went out to target, and I got a sweet-ass Billy Blazes [Rescue Hero](http://www.fisher-price.com/img/product_shots/V0294-rescue-heroes-billy-blazes-b-1.jpg). Then I waited a week for my nails to grow back a little and started biting them again, and I haven't stopped again since. But that's not the point. The point is: I'm going to use this as an excuse to get some cool sports shit.

### Treat Number One: 5 miles
If/when I run 5 miles, which would be the longest distance I have run since middle school, I will get: One (1) pair of moisture-wicking shorts and one (1) moisture-wicking shirt. Total estimated cash value: $40.00.

### Treat Number Two: 8 miles
At 8 miles, I will officially drop the cash money to register for the Baltimore Running Festival Half Marathon.

### Treat Number Three: 10 miles
The big one-oh! Good job, me. This distance seems incomprehensibly far to me today. If I successfully run ten miles, I will get a cool watch that tells me how far I run.

### Treat Number Four: 13.1 Miles
I'm leaving this one open for now, partly because I can't think of anything, and partly because it will probably be fun to think of things as I get closer. 

## Rules
1. I will run on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, following the mileage indicated on [this schedule](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program), and cross-train on Saturdays.
2. I will make a short post on this blog every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday reporting my progress.
3. If I do not meet the requirements of the schedule on any day for any reason other than illness, serious injury, or extenuating circumstance, I will publicly announce my failure to do so via Twitter or Facebook.

These are the parameters. I am now icing my shins; I have 3 miles to knock down tomorrow before Friday's rest day. There are a few things that I know will be essential if I am to have any chance at all of completing this project:

1. Diet: I need to make sure that I'm eating food makes me feel good, and doesn't sit heavy in my stomach.
2. Sleep: Last night I didn't sleep very well. If I'm going to keep up with this schedule I need to make sure that I am in bed at a reasonable hour, and that the quality of my sleep is high.
3. Routine: Not an issue yet, but when/if I start running 8+ miles, it's going to take up a decent amount of time. I need to plan for the time that running will take up.
4. Interest: I have to keep myself excited about running. Last semester I read Haruki Murakami's *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running*, and that was tremendously helpful in getting me out running for a while. It will be important that I devote time to maintaining my interest in what I'm doing.
