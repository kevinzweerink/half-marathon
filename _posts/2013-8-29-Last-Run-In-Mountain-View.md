Today's run was a good run. I overshot my distance by about half a mile, and while I wasn't super speedy, I felt like I definitely had some sort of minor breakthrough. I started out quite tired; my legs were stiff, my shins were hurting, my brain was sluggish from a day at work. Over the first half of the route, the pain and fatigue gradually improved as I started to make it clear to my body that I wasn't going to stop very soon. By the time I turned around at the halfway point, I felt tired but uninhibited, a new feeling for me. I knew my muscles were physically pretty tired, but I also knew that I had a long way to go no matter what. It began to feel more like hiking or cycling than what I usually associate with running. I was able to leave the physicality of the run behind and enjoy where I was. It was sort of like I had persuaded my legs that running was the state they were in for now, and they had accepted it to some degree. My mind was clear and content. I wonder if perhaps the reason that my Wednesday runs have historically been so bad is that they are so short that I don't bother trying to accept running as anything more than a transitional state.
