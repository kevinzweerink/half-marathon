What a great run that was! This week was a recovery week, so the mileage was down from 8 miles to 10k, but I felt much stronger and more consistent throughout the whole distance than I did for the first six miles of last week's run. My route went down to the harbor via Charles, followed the water through the inner harbor and down to Harbor East, then took Lancaster Street to Fell's Point, retraced itself back to President, turned back downtown on Lombard, and then came back up to Mt. Royal by way of Guilford, ending at Mt. Royal and Charles. I felt great the whole time, paced myself well, and by the end I didn't have any sort of deep muscle fatigue. I think a lot of the improvement was due to the change in weather; not only does it feel way better when I'm actually out running, but I've been sleeping better now that it's not like 85 degrees in my room at night. I also stopped trying to control my pace when I went down hills, and I think that made a big difference: it feels good to go fast, and it takes less energy. I just have to be more alert so I don't run into people.
