title: Strong Start After Mileage Bump
---

Today is the first day of the third two-week mileage interval in the [training program](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program) I'm following, which meant a half mile bump up to four miles for my medium length runs, and six miles for the long run this coming Sunday. I just got back from a four and a quarter mile out-and-back run to Miramonte Street, and it couldn't have gone better. Last week my legs felt stiff in the evenings due to the bike trip to work and back. Today, I waited about an hour after we arrived back at the hotel before leaving for my run, and my legs felt much better. I clocked my pace at about 9:26, which is probably a minute faster than I was doing last week for a shorter run. I felt good enough to finish out the course with about a third of a mile of fast running. Shin pain was easily bearable today (though if the pattern continues tomorrow will be awful), and fatigue didn't set in until the last half mile or so. It's surprising to feel training actually begin to pay off; when I started a month ago the weekend four-miler pushed me to the edge of my endurance. Now the same distance is (while certainly not easy) very doable. Overall, I am feeling good about my training so far.
