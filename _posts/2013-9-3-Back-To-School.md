It's nice to be running in the mornings again. I'm still transitioning from California time, so waking up at 6:00 wasn't easy, but by the time I left at 6:30 I felt fine. Nothing major to report today: not an easy run, but not a super hard one either. It was nice to beat the heat and mugginess.

Today is my first day of classes. I'm interested to see how I feel when I have to be alert shortly after a run. A lot of people say that running makes you more awake and energetic in the morning.

Next weekend is my 8 mile run. Once I do that, I'm registering for the half marathon in October. I'm getting much closer; there are only 3 miles left to add to my long run distance before I start the pre-race taper.
