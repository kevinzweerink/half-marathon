A short lap around the neighborhood for the close to my first training season since middle school. I don't think I really thought that this whole thing would go this far when I set out. The race is on Saturday. I think I'm ready, but I guess there's no way to know for sure. Confidence is probably valuable, so yes, I am ready. I spent almost three months preparing, and this weekend it will pay off. Three months isn't really all that long; it feels like it's been longer. Anyway, I think I'll save most of the reflection stuff for my post-race post. In 74 hours I'll be running the Baltimore City Running Festival Half Marathon. If you've been following this blog with any regularity, thanks! I made it mostly to keep myself on track, but I've heard from a few friends that they've been keeping up with it. It means a lot.
