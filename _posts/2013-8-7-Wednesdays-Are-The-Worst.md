Man, Wednesdays continue to suck. I ate a big burrito for lunch today, and I could definitely still feel it during my run post-dinner. My shins hurt the whole way, my pace was slow, and my form was really off. Tomorrow I am going to try my best to eat light, healthy meals for lunch and dinner, since now that I don't have time to run in the morning I have to live with those decisions (which is probably for the best, since now I don't have an excuse to pig out at every meal since I ran that morning). So far Thursdays have always gone significantly better than Wednesdays, so I'm hoping that pattern will continue.
