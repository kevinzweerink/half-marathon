title: Oh My God It's So Hot
---

Well, it's day two, and I haven't quit yet. Today's run was brutal. As it turns out, I decided to start this project right in the middle of a heat wave. According to forecast.io, it was only about 90 degrees when I was out (down from 98 earlier), but the humidity was unbelievable. My shirt was completely soaked through when I got back, but I did get back this time. I finished the full 3.1 miles, but I'm going to have to recover well if I'm going to make it through Sunday's 4 miler. I haven't started planning routes yet, but I think what I'll do is try to extend the 5k I just did a little bit in every direction, so that I don't feel the extra mile as much. The route that I ran today was one I found on mapmyrun.com, adapted a little bit to start and end right at my apartment. It was probably the nicest route I've run around here: it does an excellent job avoiding long hills, and it's got lots of turns so you're never stuck in one impossibly long stretch.

The heat wave is supposed to break by Sunday, but I think I may have to move my runs to either pre- or post-daylight regardless.     I've found in the past that I don't usually do well in the mornings, but I'm fine heading out at 10:30 or 11 PM. On the other hand, that makes for somewhat of a late night, and it can be nice to get a run out of the way early in the day.
