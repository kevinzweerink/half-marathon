Today was bad. My shins hurt the whole time, and my quads were very sore, and it felt like I was close to pulling something where they meet up with the hips. I made it up to Hopkins and most of the way back down, but at North Avenue I decided to stop because I could feel that my form had gotten terrible, and I was worried that my sloppiness could end up hurting me. I hope that tomorrow is better than today was; the temperature should be a bit warmer. I think I will ice my shins later tonight.
