Today is the first day of my taper. I guess Sunday actually was by accident, but today is the first real day. The schedule is kind of up to me now because it has the half marathon on a Sunday, but mine is actually on a Saturday, so I need to stop running by Thursday, which means that the 4-3-2 progression on the schedule has to be reduced to just two distances. So today I ran 3.7, and tomorrow I'll run 2. Today my friend Karen came running, which was the first time throughout this whole thing that I've run with anybody else. We ran a bit faster than I usually do alone: 8'06" pace and a really fast sprint at the end. It finally cooled off again here in Baltimore, which is a relief after this weekend, which made it into the 90's. I'm feeling better about what happened on Sunday. I think it will work out fine, since the training schedule I've been following usually does 2 weeks of distance increase followed by one rest week that's shorter. If the schedule had continued that pattern through this week (which it didn't because it had the half marathon set for this past weekend), it would have had another rest week. So I think I'll be fine.
