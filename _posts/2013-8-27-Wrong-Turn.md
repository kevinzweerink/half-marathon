Today's run was alright. I set out directly after work, rather than biking back to the hotel first. I was unfamiliar with the area I was running in, and accidentally cut off about six tenths of a mile from my planned distance of 4.5 miles. When I got back and realized my mistake, I went back out and ran another 1.3ish miles, which I think made up for my original shortcoming.
