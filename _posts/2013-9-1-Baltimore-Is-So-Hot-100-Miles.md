Jesus Baltimore is stupid hot. And humid. And I am pretty sure that this is the sweatiest I have ever been in my whole life. That was a really tough run. But it was also the longest run I've ever done in my whole life. And now it is over and I am back at home with my fan. I walked for one block at about 6.75 miles. I was going up a steep hill, and I was really tired. I stopped paying attention for a second and my body stopped running. I walked the rest of the block, then finished the course running. I'm not going to be too hard on myself about that for a couple reasons: 

1. I had never run for that long before; 
2. It is at least 10 degrees hotter and 50% more humid here than in Mountain View; and 
3. I flew across the country yesterday and got in around midnight last night. So, all things considered, I think I did alright.

Also, today marked my hundredth mile since the beginning of the training program. That's pretty cool I think.
