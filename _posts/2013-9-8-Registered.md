A clean eight miles! All the way down to Fort McHenry and back to the Washington Monument, no walking! The hill going up to the Pratt Library on Cathedral was brutal, but I didn't stop. I knew I had to finish clean so that I could register for the half marathon today, and that's what I did. It feels very good.
