This morning's run went pretty well. It's supposed to be 100 degrees today, but it wasn't too bad while I was out running. My route today took me down to the Inner Harbor via Cathedral and back up to Mt. Royal on Charles Street. I was tired by the end, but not tremendously so. I realized this morning that my mid-length runs are now longer than my long runs were at the beginning of the training program. On my way back I saw the food truck for the House of Cards production team. I tweeted at Kevin Spacey to ask him if he wants to go running tomorrow morning, because I saw a picture of him photobombing somebody while he was running. It would be cool if that happened!
