I woke up before my alarm today, at 5:55. I felt good, much better than I did yesterday morning. I got up easily, ate a banana, drank some water, and waited for 6:30 to head out. This morning was very nice: the sun was rising, there were very few clouds, and the temperature was cool. Today's run on the schedule was only 2 miles, and I was glad because my shins started bothering me early in my run this morning. After I got back home I did some research and found a [Gizmodo article](http://gizmodo.com/5902699/banish-shin-splints-forever-with-one-magical-exercise) that claims to have a great exercise to alleviate shin splints. I tried it out and I could definitely feel the muscles that the moves work on, so I'm going to give it a shot for the next week or so and see if anything changes.

All things considered, one week in, I'm feeling pretty good. I'm tired; I don't think I've fully recovered from Sunday's run yet, but I'm definitely improving. Tomorrow is probably going to be painful, but I can't lose momentum.
