Ten miles! That's the peak distance on my training plan. Even though I still have another long run before the race, I am at the end of the Hal Higdon training plan. I decided to run the majority of the race course today, but backwards so that I could start from my house and end up at the circulator. I took Howard up to Johns Hopkins, followed 33rd to Lake Montebello, did a lap around the lake, to Hillen to Harford, then turned into Clifton Park on St. Lo, which turned into Washington, then took a left on Madison, then right on Linwood down to Eastern, which I took back to President Street for a total of 10.19 miles. Man though, the course for the race is *really* hilly. I took it backwards, so after Lake Montebello the general incline is decidedly downhill, but there were still a lot of surprisingly steep climbs. Running that the other way on race day is going to be rough for sure. I may try to reverse my route from today for my long run next weekend, just so I'll know for sure what I'm dealing with. I'm sure it will also feel shorter now that I'm familiar with the area. I had never been to a lot of the places I went through today. One guy, getting out of his car, asked me if the marathon was today. I told him no, it's in two weeks, I was just practicing.
