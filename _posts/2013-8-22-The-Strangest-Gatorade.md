Today's run went a little worse than a usual Thursday run. I felt great for the first half, but coming back I got some more shin pain. I remembered to do my shin splint exercises though, so that's good. Plus, this weekend is the first cutback weekend on my training schedule. My "long" run this Sunday is only a 5k, so that should give my legs a good rest before next week, which bumps up my medium runs to 4.5 miles, my short runs to 3 miles, and my long run to 7 miles. The long runs also start increasing weekly rather than biweekly. 

Anyways, right now I'm drinking gatorade that was left in the perfect part of my motel fridge to become exactly semi-frozen. That is to say that it is not like one big chunk of ice in a pool of gatorade, nor is it a homogenous substance made of consistently broken down ice like a slurpee. It is something much more like slush that you find in a parking lot in March. It holds together in a big clump, and seems highly malleable.
