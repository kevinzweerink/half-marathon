I felt a lot better today than I did yesterday (as always happens this time of the week). I ran the same route that I did on Tuesday. Running at the end of a long day at work immediately after biking home is a completely different experience than running early in the morning. Ordinarily, you don't really realize how much a day wears you out. I seem to start out really rough after biking home; my legs are heavy and stiff, and my shins hurt a lot. The first 1.5 miles or so are very mental. After a while though, things loosen up, but I never feel like I get that spring in my step that I felt on good morning runs. Towards the end of the run, I've found that I get a second wind. Maybe it's the course I've been running, maybe it's the time of day, I don't really know, but I find my legs moving faster and faster, and I usually finish the course in a sprint. Even still, I feel tight and not-quite-comfortable.

I am looking forward to this weekend's run, I am excited to see if perhaps this week of training with little remaining glycogen stores will put me in a better position for my long runs.
