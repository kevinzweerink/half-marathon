Today's run was fine. I went down Cathedral to Pratt, and back up Charles. Uneventful, mostly. I did sprint as fast as I could up the one block hill to the Monument when coming back on Charles. That was pretty fun, and it was surprising how easy it was considering that I was pretty tired at regular pace. I guess maybe sprinting uses your muscles differently so they are less tired. Tomorrow will be my last 5 mile training run for this race. Sunday is the last long run, and next week the schedule tapers down to four, three, and then two miles.s
