I've been thinking about what I measure myself by. It's not something I've thought about much before, but I feel like it's an essential question. I have always been one for challenges. I'm a very competitive person, and when I decide that I'd like to be good at something I don't give up easily. I'd like to say that it's an internal drive, but I don't know that it is. Standing out among my peers motivates me to work hard and focus, but I know this isn't the healthiest or most sustainable type of motivation.

Perhaps what interests me about running is that it forces me to develop and train an internal persistence. On race day there will be plenty of people to beat, but in the preceding weeks, months, or years, the only one to compete against is myself.

Today I thought I was going to throw up. I planned a route that took me down to the Inner Harbor via Charles, followed a quick loop down President Street and headed back up the Jones Falls Trail. I thought it would be a good route because it has a lot of flat areas; the Jones Falls Trail compresses the hills of Mt. Vernon into a single climb at the very end of the route. I've always hated hills, but now I'm not so sure. The flatness of the Harbor area and the beginning of the Jones Falls Trail really wore me down, which made the final push at the end was exhausting. A flat course requires consistent output over a long period. Hills allow for smooth transitions from high output to low output. This pulse makes pacing easy. I never thought I would come to appreciate hills, but I'm finding more and more that I enjoy their rhythm.

On that last climb, after a solid two miles of flat ground, I nearly stopped. I was nauseous, the air was stagnant, and the hill stretched ahead of me. I didn't stop. Finally, the Jones Falls Trail merged with Guilford Avenue, and I could see the intersection that was to be my stopping point. I made it to the light, and then I kept going for another block, bringing my total to 4.24 miles.

If I had stopped on the hill, I would have run 3.9 miles, only one tenth of a mile short of my required distance for today. But that tenth of a mile is what this training is about. Continuing to move forward when every step is a kick in the gut is as much mental as it is physical, and that brand of persistence is something that's worth measuring myself by.
