Today's run went far better than yesterday's. My route took me up again to Hopkins, this time looping through the campus and returning on Charles to end at Mount Royal for a total of three and three-quarters miles. The route I planned was actually shorter, but I took a wrong turn on the Hopkins campus and ended up adding an extra quarter mile without realizing. I felt good the whole time, there was minimal shin pain, and the light drizzle kept me cool, though unfortunately it picked up into a heavier rain that soaked me thoroughly as I walked home. I feel like recently (excepting yesterday) I've been able to find a sort of stasis while running that was previously difficult to achieve; a combination of good pacing and mental preparation that makes it easier to remove oneself from the physical act of running.

I thought a lot yesterday about what could be causing my poor performance on Wednesdays, which are supposed to be the easiest day of my training schedule. A few things I've noticed that I do most nights before a run, but have not done on Tuesday nights:

1. Carrots with peanut butter. I think that the slow-digesting carbs and protein from the peanut butter help me out a lot in the morning.
2. Icing my shins/legs. I haven't done this on Tuesdays yet because I've been assuming the shorter distance should be easier, and I feel strong on my Tuesday morning runs.
3. Underestimating. I assume that because the distance is short it will be easy and I don't pump myself up as well. Two miles isn't long, but my legs are probably still recovering from the long run on Sunday.

Anyway, next Tuesday I'll try to be more conscious of what I eat the night before and take care of my legs a little better. Today's run went excellently though, and I'm excited for my 5 mile run on Sunday
