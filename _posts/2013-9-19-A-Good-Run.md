This morning was way better than yesterday. I took the same route as Tuesday: down Charles, around the piers in the harbor to Harbor East, back up President to Lombard to Guilford to Mt. Royal to Charles. There are usually a few other runners down on the piers in the morning, and today I was one of the faster ones out there. I also talked to one guy for a minute about how nice out it was. And it was very nice out. It was a bit warmer than yesterday, so I was cool but comfortable in shorts and a t-shirt. The sun was rising toward Fells Point, and at every intersection I could look over at it and see it getting a little higher. There's one stretch of Guilford that I've discovered is really beautiful in the morning; for about 100 yards the sidewalk is lined with tall bushes that do a really excellent job diffusing the light, so when you run past them while the sun is rising your skin looks like it's glowing, and the light seems to be more like a sunset than a sunrise.

This weekend is my longest long run yet, at 9 miles. I am a little nervous, but if it goes as well as this morning went I think I can do it no problem.
