I ran six miles today. Just barely, because I got confused at the turnaround point and accidentally cut off about a third of a mile, but still a clean six. Also, it was real hilly. I am in San Francisco for the weekend, and I thought I had planned a fairly flat route from the hotel to Fort Mason and back via Van Ness, but found myself clearly mistaken as Van Ness first turned steeply up, and then dropped even further and more steeply down toward the bay. My pace on the climbs was sluggish, but I'm sure to an experienced San Franciscan runner the planar hills I found so impressive would be considered a nice break from many of the roads I saw intersecting Van Ness that might be closer to sheer cliffs than flat ground. Even though I have been training for the past two weeks in flat Mountain View, I was glad to find that the hills did not tire me out as much as they slowed me down. By the end of the six mile round trip, I was tired, to be certain, but not exhausted. I was able to complete my longest distance yet, another PBSMS (Personal Best Since Middle School), without excessive difficulty.
