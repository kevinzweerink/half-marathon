I kept hoping the pain in my shins would fade on my short run today, but it never did. I did my best to keep good form and pace myself properly, but I just couldn't get into a good groove. My route took me up to Hopkins and back today. It went okay; I didn't walk or anything, but my shins were aching the whole way. Hopefully they will feel better tomorrow. I may try running in my old shoes to see if that helps.
