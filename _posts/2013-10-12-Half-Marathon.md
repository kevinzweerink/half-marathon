I'm a little late in posting this. It's now Monday, the race was on Saturday. I finished! I don't have time to write a long post about it at the moment, but generally speaking it feels good. I ended up walking a little, starting around mile 10, but I made it all the way up the hills before it came to that. 13 miles is a long way to run. I'm considering running the Rock and Roll half in DC in March, but I haven't come to a decision yet. While I'm glad I did this race, I don't know if it's something I want to do regularly. Training for long distances is time consuming and exhausting. My plan from here is to cut back my mileage, probably to about 4-6 miles, 4 times a week, and also start working on building more muscle in my legs and core, to ward off injuries. Then if I do decide to do the DC half marathon, I'll start training in December. More to come next weekend.
