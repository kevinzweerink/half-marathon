Today I ran two laps around a 1.5 mile neighborhood loop. Yesterday, when I left for class, I noticed a twinge in my left ankle, sort of behind the bone, near the achilles tendon. It wasn't bad, but it was definitely different than a normal soreness. I massaged it and iced it a lot yesterday, and today it did feel a lot better, though still not completely healed. I contemplated taking today off to let the ankle heal further, but instead I decided to plan a short, repeated route that would never be further than about half a mile from my house in case things went badly. Luckily, nothing did go badly: the tendon seems to be sensitive to walking more than running, as long as I maintain a mid-to-fore-foot strike. I think it came about because I lost some of my calluses, so I was running more on the outside edge of my feet to keep my weight off the blisters. Today I tried to be conscious and run with my whole foot instead of just the outside, and I think I did a little better.
