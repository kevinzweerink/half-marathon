Today is the first of the biweekly mileage bumps incorporated into my [training program](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program), so instead of running 3 miles, today I ran 3.5 (3.6, really), tomorrow is still 2, Thursday is 3.5 again, and Sunday is 5, which is where I get my first prize. I actually felt great this morning. The course went up Howard to Charles Village, then returned on Charles and extended up into Mount Vernon a little. I had a bit of shin pain starting out, but it dissolved quickly. I taped the arch on my right foot because I was having some pain in my abductor hallucis, and the tape provided a lot more support than I thought it would. For the first time, I can really feel the benefits of the program; my form was strong, I ran a sub-10 minute pace, and I finished strong.
