This morning's five miles went easily and quickly. I was a little worried because I still had a lot of calf stiffness left over from Sunday, particularly in my left leg. But everything loosened up quickly, despite the cool temperatures. I got to wear my cool long-sleeved running shirt for the first time, and I found out that it has a nifty pocket for my house key to go in, and it could also fit a snack or something. I felt good enough toward the end to run the last three-quarters of a mile pretty fast, even though it was mostly uphill. Hopefully tomorrow's three miles will go smoother than last week's.
