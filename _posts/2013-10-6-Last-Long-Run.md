This was a really demoralizing day. It was hot and sunny and extraordinarily humid. I only made it about 4.5 miles before I started walking. I was already almost out of water, I was tired, I was in a bad mood, and it was disgusting outside. I'm angry with myself now, which isn't helping anything, but I walked about 4 miles out of the 10 mile route today, which is not a good thing to do a week out from the race. I only have two more runs before race day, and I'm nervous that since I didn't run for the full distance today my muscle will start to degrade before next saturday. I was running the course for the race—the right direction this time—and it is really quite hilly. I think I psyched myself out because I knew what was ahead. Anyway, bad day today. I need to try and move on quickly so that this doesn't get me down during the week.
